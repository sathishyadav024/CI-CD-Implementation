# ELASTICBEANSTALK :

The elasticbeanstalk is works as a platform as a service

Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. Upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deploymentâ€”from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto scaling to application health monitoring.
